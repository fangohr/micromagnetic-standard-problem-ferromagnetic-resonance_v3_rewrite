## Quick start

Depending on your interest and expertise, you can use this repository in various ways.

- Download or browse the data files underlying figures 2-5 in the paper.

- Re-produce the main figures 2-5 in the paper from pre-computed reference data. (No micromagnetic software needed.)

- Run our micromagnetic simulation scripts to re-generate the data files (OOMMF required).

  You can then (optionally) produce figures 2-5 from this re-computed data.
  This is useful to verify that you get the same results on your own computer.

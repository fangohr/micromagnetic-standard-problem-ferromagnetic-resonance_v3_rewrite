This directory is will contain the "raw" simulation data generated by
running the micromagnetic simulation scripts in
[src/micromagnetic_simulation_scripts/](../../src/micromagnetic_simulation_scripts/)

To produce the raw data, run the following commands in the toplevel
directory of this repository.

    make generate-oommf-data
    make generate-nmag-data

Alternatively, you can run the scripts called `generate_data.sh`
in the `oommf` and `nmag` subfolders of the directory containing
the micromagnetic simulation scripts.
